# Rust Exporter for Prometheus

 a complete, modular monitoring solution for  validator nodes and stake pools 
based on the Solana Rust Exporter. The main component is a [Solana](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana) m
etrics exporter for Prometheus
initially based on the [Golang original](https://github.com/certusone/solana_exporter) by CertusOne
but rewritten in Rust and now providing plenty of additional functionality. It is the basis for
Grafana dashboards and status alerts.
